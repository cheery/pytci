# Python Compiler Infrastructure

The Pytsi -initiative's goal is to provide a C compiler that is easy to set up, understand and maintain.

So far it parses trigraphs and tokenizes.

I programmed Pytsi to run on Python 2.7.10 because [PEP 0492](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/) is one big clusterfuck. The effort to complicate python compiler should be directed towards standardizing greenlets instead.
